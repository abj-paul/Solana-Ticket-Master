* About
Our main codebase is written in Candy Machine V3 so checkout cmv3 folder to execute the code.

* Reference
We followed [[https://www.quicknode.com/guides/solana-development/nfts/how-to-create-a-solana-nft-collection-using-candy-machine-v3-and-typescript#set-up-your-project][this guide]] to get the boilerplate code. 

Additionally [[https://github.com/solana-developers/compressed-nfts/blob/master/scripts/createAndMint.ts][this github on compressed NFT]] is extremely helpful.

Finally, We followed [[https://solana.com/developers/guides/token-extensions/getting-started][Official Token 2022 Solana]] documetnation to get nontransferability and Fee Configuration codes. We used them to build our final version of contract which currently resiedes in token-2022/combined.ts file.
So to run our final program. do the following:

Also, we got NFT creation code in token-2022 from [[https://www.quicknode.com/guides/solana-development/spl-tokens/token-2022/nft][this link]].
#+begin_src bash
cd token-2022
npm install
npx esrun combined.ts
#+end_src

We will now follow [[https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/overview][official candy machine documentation]] to add the following features.
1. Max number of tickets a user can buy
2. Recording each users who has bought the NFT, serially
3. If possible, max purchase limit
