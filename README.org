* About
Our main codebase is written in Candy Machine V3 so checkout cmv3 folder to execute the code.

* Reference
We followed [[https://www.quicknode.com/guides/solana-development/nfts/how-to-create-a-solana-nft-collection-using-candy-machine-v3-and-typescript#set-up-your-project][this guide]] to get the boilerplate code. 

Additionally [[https://github.com/solana-developers/compressed-nfts/blob/master/scripts/createAndMint.ts][this github on compressed NFT]] is extremely helpful.

We will now follow [[https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/overview][official candy machine documentation]] to add the following features.
1. Max number of tickets a user can buy
2. Recording each users who has bought the NFT, serially
3. If possible, max purchase limit
